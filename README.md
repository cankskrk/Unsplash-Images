# Unsplash Image Search Project

This project is built using **React, React Context API, Unsplash API, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**.

## 📌 Project Purpose

The main goal of this project is to **fetch images from the Unsplash API** dynamically based on user input. Users can search for any keyword, and the application retrieves and displays relevant images.

## 🚀 Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can enter any keyword to search for images.
- **Unsplash API Integration**: Fetches images dynamically based on user queries.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes.
- **React Context API**: Manages global state efficiently.
- **TypeScript Support**: Ensures type safety and maintainability.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with **Tailwind CSS** for a modern and responsive layout.

## 📂 How It Works

1. Users **enter a search query** in the input field.
2. The app makes a request to the **Unsplash API** to fetch matching images.
